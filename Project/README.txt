In order to show the visualization there are 2 possibilities:

1- go to the BUILD folder directory (\build) and run it on a simple python server (exactly like in the d3 tutorial);

2- It can also be run using node.js local server, by going to the directory of the project (\data-vis) in a windows PowerShell
and write "npm install" then after it finishes "npm run" to directly show the visualization.

The source codes can be found in the directory: (\data-vis\src\components)
